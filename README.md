Things left to do: 
1. adding the context to the conversation (this is a single message interaction app)
2. fixing the bug with the voice button from the application response (once you click it, it will replay and overplay each time you click)
3. adding a filter to remove the biological fingerprint for the user --> changing the user voice before sending it to the API for application or any further use in the future)
